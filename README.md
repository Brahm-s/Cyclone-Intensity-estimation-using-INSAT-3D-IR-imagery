# Cyclone-Intensity-estimation-using-INSAT-3D-IR-imagery
Our project leverages infrared images in a robust dataset for cyclone prediction. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) extracts intricate visual patterns, while a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) captures temporal nuances. Together, they empower precise forecasting of maximum wind intensities, revolutionizing tropical cyclone predictions.
